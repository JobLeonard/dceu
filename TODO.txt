# NEXT

- error messages in XCEU
- evt/err globals
    - broadcast @[...]  <-- evt cannot be assigned anywhere
    - throw @[...]      <-- err cannot be assigned anywhere
- count memory
- pool kill/while
    - iter
    - nested bcast
    - no escape
    - kills after iters=0
- task.pub
- tags
    - implement with vector or list?
    - tag hier or tag of tag?
- polymorphism
    - poly var
    - set f = func (a#x, b#y)
    - set MAX#x = 10
- ~= (like)
    - 1 ~= "1"
    - #x ~= #x.y
    - str ~= ".*"
- xceu
    - ifs exp as it { it==1 {}
    - iter xs as x
    - do exp as it {}
    - func f { ... }
    - par, paror, parand

# BACK

- coroutines(max)
- native `#pre`
- kill: coro, coros
- emit only plain values b/c of bcast
- tuple is plain immutable value
    - move on assign
    - no scope error
    - unless holds dyns
- native pre code
- collections
    - tup.a, .b, .x
    - @dict, @[...]
    - $vec,  $[...], homogeneous, string
    - $size
- char type
- args keyword (or ...)
    - access to variable args from func args
- err keyword
    - access to ceu_has_throw value
- tag of tag requires higher ID to avoid cycle
- ((1>>f)>>g) -> g(f(1))
- parser
    - reject no assign stmts
        - defer
        - while
        - ?
    - reject anything after throw (last stmt)
    - reject yield with no direct enclosing task
- closures
    - only accept dyns as upvalue
    - has same scope as upval
- 3 `add` 4  -->  add(3,4)
- move as a primitive?
    - needs to move nested objs
    - var x = [...] ; move x (up)
- ceu2c
    - struct <- tuple
    - vec <- buf
- call w/o blocks optimize

# IDEAS

- code NAV tree
- lessmilk
- 7 guis
- IUP
- doc pico-sdl/ceu
- incremental GC
    - is a coro itself (start from leaves, back to root)
- contracts
- android SDK
